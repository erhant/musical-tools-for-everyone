# Musical Tools for Everyone

**Made for the sake of music and for the fun of programming :)** Used [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/) with TypeScript for setup, and [Mantine](https://www.mantine.dev/) for UI.

Practice your instrument or learn more about music theory with these beautiful tools:

- **Formula Reader:** Give a formula and root note and learn the corresponding notes! For example, giving `1-3-5` and `C` gives you `C E G`.
- **Note Generator:** Randomly generate notes every few seconds. Find them on your instrument and play before the notes change!
- **Metronome:** Good ol' metronome, very simple.
- **Key Signatures:** A trainer about key signatures.
- **Circle of Fifths:** An interactive circle of fifths visualizer _todo_
- **Fretboard:** An interactive fretboard visualizer _todo_

Generated notes are written both in text, as well as on a stave using [Vexflow](https://www.vexflow.com/). Sounds are generated via [ToneJS](https://tonejs.github.io/).
